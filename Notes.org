* Todos
** DONE setup Meep simulation
** DONE Compute some ressonances and check the with meep (have done k=0)
** TODO Replicate the results from the paper for our geometry
** TODO Compute a complete band structure
** TODO Make code to compute the polarization vector correctly
** TODO Reread the papers for what new structures we can consider
** TODO Compute the polarization vector for a part of the BZ
** TODO Check for the topological terms of interest.

* Notes
E_z excites the TM modes as expected
